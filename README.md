# Introduction #

This is a client utility set for a Yenot server.

### how to use ###

This includes a CLI and qt GUI interface.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
python build-client.py
```

### there is also a package builder for a windows installer ###

It requires installing the Python module mako and WiX the .msi builder.  But,
frankly, this has far less support than anything else here.
